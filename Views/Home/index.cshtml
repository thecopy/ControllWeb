    <h1>Simple Remote Controlling!</h1>
    <p>Have you ever wanted to be able to just write a quick script and then 5 minutes later executing it from your smart phone? 
        Then Controll is for you!
    </p>
    <p>
        Controll is a simple framework which isn't able to do anything without your plugins!<br/>
        Some buzzwords:

    <ul>
        <li>Simple</li>
        <li>The Cloud</li>
        <li>Real Time</li>
        <li>Lightweight</li>
        <li>Extendable and Versatile</li>

        Don't worry! You don't have to fiddle and spend time with your router or your firewall to get your zombie to work!
    </p>
    Oh, you don't know what a <strong>zombie</strong> is? My bad! A zombie is like a client to the Controll
    servers, but instead of telling plugins on <i>other devices</i> to run, <i>they</i> are the ones doing the actual execution!<br/>
    And because you have the Controll servers in which everything passes through: you don't have to worry about time consuming firewalls and routers.

        <h1>How do i create a plugin?</h1>
    </div>
    <p>
        Im happy that you wanted to learn more! To create a plugin, your class only have to 
        extend <code class="prettyprint">IActivity</code>. And then write your code
        in the <code class="prettyprint">Execute</code> method and bam - <strong>you're ready to go!</strong>
    </p>
    
    <h2>Wow, that wasn't much at all!</h2>
    <p>
        Besides adding <a href="@Url.Content("~/Documentation/#coding-plugins")">creating small view model</a> for it: <strong>That's it!</strong>

        <li>Start your zombie executable and enter:<br/>
        
            <ul>

                <li><pre>>> sync</pre></li>
            </ul>

        There! Now your zombie is ready to execute your plugin from other devices!
    </p>
    <h2>What devices can i use?</h2>
    <p>
        At the moment you have to have a .NET runtime installed to use Controll. A prototype client for iOS 
        have been created and it works (sort of). This means that you are limited to Windows or by using Mono.
